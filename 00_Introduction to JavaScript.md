                                                  JAVASCRIPT

<h2 align="center"><b> DEFINE A JAVASCRIPT</b></h2>

* JavaScript lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded programming language and  interpreted language .
* "Logic of the Website".
* Initially created to “MAKE WEB PAGES COME ALIVE” (i.e., make them interactive).
* The programs written in JavaScript are called “Scripts.”
* JavaScript is written inside a web page using HTML, and it runs **automatically when the page loads**.

  <h4 align="center"><b>Client -side </b></h4>

   * JavaScript works along with HTML and CSS. HTML adds structure to a web page, CSS styles it, and JavaScript brings it to life

    by allowing users to interact with elements on the page, such as actions on clicking buttons, filling out forms.

   <h4 align="center"><b> Server -side </b></h4>

   * On the Server side (on Web Servers), JavaScript is used to access databases, file handling, and security features to send responses, to browsers.

<h2 align="center"><b>Why is it called JavaScript?</b></h2>


* The original name of JavaScript was “LiveScript.”
* During the time, **Java was very popular**, so the creators renamed LiveScript to “JavaScript” to take advantage of Java’s popularity.
* JavaScript can execute **not only in browser** ,but also on the server or actually on the any device that has a special program call **"Javascript Engine"**.

<h2 align="center"><b>JavaScript Engine Names</b></h2>

* **V8** - in chrome,Opera and edge.
* **Spider Monkey** - Fire Fox
  
<h3 align="center"><b>Purpose of a JavaScript Engine</b></h3>

* Read the script.
* Converts script to **Machine code**.
* Runs,preety  **very fast**.

<h2 align="center"><b>JavaScript – What It CAN’T and CAN Do (Browser Level)</b></h2>

🔒 1. **JavaScript CANNOT read or write files on your computer**.

Your local files are safe. JavaScript running in a browser has no direct access to your system files.

🎥 2. **JavaScript CANNOT secretly open your camera or microphone**.

Camera/Mic access always requires your permission through a browser popup.

🗂 3. **Websites CANNOT access other browser tabs**

Example: A website cannot read your Gmail, banking, or any other open tabs.

🌐 4. **JavaScript CAN communicate with its own server normally**.

This is done using APIs like fetch(), XHR, or AJAX, but only with servers it is allowed to talk to.

<h3  align="center"><b>ECMA Script</b></h3>

 *  **ECMAScripts** is  offical stanadard behind JavaScript.
 *  Created by **Brendan Eich** at **Netscape**.
 *  The Standarization process handled by **ECMA International**.
 *  ECMA  used to **Syntax,Semantics,Features**.
