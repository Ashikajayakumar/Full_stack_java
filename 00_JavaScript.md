  #JavaScript – What It CAN’T and CAN Do (Browser Level)

🔒 1. **JavaScript CANNOT read or write files on your computer**.
Your local files are safe. JavaScript running in a browser has no direct access to your system files.

🎥 2. **JavaScript CANNOT secretly open your camera or microphone**.
Camera/Mic access always requires your permission through a browser popup.

🗂 3. **Websites CANNOT access other browser tabs**
Example: A website cannot read your Gmail, banking, or any other open tabs.

🌐 4. **JavaScript CAN communicate with its own server normally**.
This is done using APIs like fetch(), XHR, or AJAX, but only with servers it is allowed to talk to.
